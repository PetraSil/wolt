2. Audit the UI
3. Clean the SASS files (too much redundancy)
4. Create a clear readme
5. Comment the code better
6. Create more sorting options for the front (bonus)
7. Do a code review and cleanup
8. Pull data from database to restaurant page. Name and image is enough.
9. Some tests (Cypress?)
10. Nearby restaurants buttons do not work right now due to logic being moved to back. Fix this.
